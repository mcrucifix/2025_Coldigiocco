- show two solutions with different k terms

- visualise two different precession rates. We could use the fresh Julia code ? 

- redo the eccentricity wavelet plot and comment it. It would be nice to superimpose it to the time series. 

- anotate the g spectrum with 'g' terms 

- precession also causes chaos
