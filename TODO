- show two solutions with different k terms
- make a showcase for the eccentricity g3-g4 breaking
- add a figure with the analytical solution of BREtagnon


- make bibliography
- make Makefile with .qmd

- visualise two different precession rates. We could use the fresh Julia code ? 

- redo the eccentricity wavelet plot and comment it. It would be nice to superimpose it to the time series. 

- precession also causes chaos
